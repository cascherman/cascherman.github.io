            <h1>A Language Learning Journey</h1>
            <p>This is my first attempt at a website - I plan to log my journey as I learn how to speak these languages over the web. Not sure where this will take me, but I plan to make hyperlinks <a href="http://www.google.com">Click Me!</a> with dates and progress reports</p>

            <h1>Plan for the Website</h1>
            <p>I hope for this site to consist of several things each day that I post</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A summary of my daily learnings</li>
                <li>A picture of the code from that day</li>
                <li>other things... (looking for another bullet point for the unordered list)  :)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>On the next post I need to create the title page and then put this page into hyperlink, after that I'll need to figure out how to organize files in Windows Explorer, then find a place to publish the site.</p>
