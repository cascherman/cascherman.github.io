                <p>The MX-5's first generation, the NA, sold over 400,000 units from May 1989 to 1997—with a 1.6 L (98 cu in) inline-four engine to 1993, a 1.8 L (110 cu in) engine thereafter (with a de-tuned 1.6 as a budget option in some markets)—recognizable by its pop-up headlights. The second generation (NB) was introduced in 1999 with a slight increase in engine power; it can be recognized by the fixed headlights and the glass rear window, although first generation owners may opt for the glass window design when replacing the original top. The third generation (NC) was introduced in 2006 with a 2.0 L (120 cu in) engine and slightly larger body size, with a Power Retractable Hard Top variant added in 2007. The fourth generation (ND) was introduced in 2015 with a new 2.0 L (120 cu in) SKYACTIV-G engine and a body size similar to the first generation model, with a Retractable Fastback (RF) variant added later that year.</p>
                <p>Launched at a time when production of small roadsters had almost come to an end, the Alfa Romeo Spider was the only comparable volume model in production at the time of the MX-5's launch. Just a decade earlier, a host of similar models—notably the MG B, Triumph TR7, Triumph Spitfire, and Fiat Spider—had been available.</p>

                <header>Design</header>
                <p>In 1976, Bob Hall, a journalist at Motor Trend magazine who was an expert in Japanese cars and fluent in the language, met Kenichi Yamamoto and Gai Arai, head of Research and Development at Mazda. Yamamoto and Gai Arai asked Hall what kind of car Mazda should make in the future</p>
                <p><q>I babbled [...] how the [...] simple, bugs-in-the-teeth, wind-in-the-hair, classically-British sports car doesn't exist any more. I told Mr. Yamamoto that somebody should build one [...] inexpensive roadster.</q></p>
                <p>In 1981, Hall moved to a product planning position with Mazda USA and again met Yamamoto, now chairman of Mazda Motors, who remembered their conversation about a roadster and in 1982 gave Hall the go-ahead to research the idea further.[8] At this time Hall hired designer Mark Jordan to join the newly formed Mazda design studio in Southern California. There, Hall and Jordan collaborated on the parameters of the initial image, proportion and visualization of the "light-weight sports" concept. In 1983, the idea turned concept was approved under the "Offline 55" program, an internal Mazda initiative that sought to change the way new models were developed. Thus, under head of project Masakatsu, the concept development was turned into a competition between the Mazda design teams in Tokyo and California.[8]</p>
                <p>The Californian team proposed a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, codenamed Duo 101, in line with the British roadster ancestry, but their Japanese counterparts favored the more common front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout or the rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout.</p>
                <p>The first round of judging the competing designs was held in April 1984, with designs presented on paper only. The mid-engined car appeared to offer favorable qualities, although it was known at the time that such a layout would struggle to meet the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) requirements of the project. It was only at the second round of the competition in August 1984, when full-scale clay models were presented, that the Duo 101 won the competition and was selected as the basis for what would become the MX-5. The Duo 101, so named as either a soft top or hardtop could be used, incorporated many key stylistic cues inspired by the Lotus Elan, a 1960s roadster, including the door handles and grille opening. International Automotive Design (IAD) in Worthing, England was commissioned to develop a running prototype, codenamed V705. It was built with a fiberglass body, a 1.4 L (85 cu in) engine from a Mazda Familia and components from a variety of early Mazda models. The V705 was completed in August 1985 and taken to the US where it rolled on the roads around Santa Barbara, California and got positive reactions.</p>
                <p>The project received final approval on 18 January 1986.[8] The model's codename was changed to P729 as it moved into the production phase, under head of program Toshihiko Hirai. The task of constructing five engineering mules (more developed prototypes) was again allocated to IAD, which also conducted the first front and rear crash tests on the P729. While Tom Matano,[11] Mark Jordan, Wu-huang Chin (秦無荒, also on the RX-7 team), Norman Garrett, and Koichi Hayashi (林 浩一) worked on the final design, the project was moved to Japan for engineering and production details. By 1989, with a definitive model name now chosen, the MX-5 was ready to be introduced to the world as a true lightweight sports car, weighing just 940 kg (2,070 lb). Although Mazda's concept was for the MX-5 to be an inexpensive sports car, at introduction the design met strong demand, with many dealers placing customers on pre-order lists and several dealers across North America increasing the vehicle markup.</p>
                <p>Mazda used a design credo across the four generations of the MX-5's development: the phrase Jinba ittai (人馬一体, [dʑimba ittai]),[12] which translates loosely into English as "rider (jin) and horse (ba) as one body (ittai)". With the first generation of the MX-5, the phrase was developed into five specific core design requirements:</p>
                <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
                    <li>That the car be as compact and as light as possible while meeting global safety requirements.</li>
                    <li>That the cockpit comfortably accommodate two full-stature occupants with no wasted space.</li>
                    <li>That the basic layout continue with the original's front-midship rear-drive configuration with the engine positioned ahead of the driver but behind the front axle for 50:50 weight distribution.</li>
                    <li>That all four wheels be attached by wishbone or multi-link suspension systems to maximize tire performance, road grip, and dynamic stability.</li>
                    <li>And that a power-plant frame again provide a solid connection between the engine and rear-mounted differential to sharpen throttle response.</li>
                </ul>

Inspired by the post-war era British sports cars, the MX-5 rejuvenated interest in roadsters after the demise of cars such as the MG B and Triumph Spitfire. Since its debut, the MX-5 has won numerous automotive awards and has become the world's best selling sports car.</p>

While it kept the same proportions of its predecessor, its most noticeable change was the deletion of the retractable headlamps, which no longer passed pedestrian safety tests and were replaced by fixed ones.</p>
                <p>The Mazda MX-5 (NB) is the second generation of the Mazda MX-5 manufactured from 1998 to 2005. The model continued the MX-5's philosophy of being a lightweight, front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive roadster while featuring numerous performance improvements, however lacking its predecessor's retractable headlamps. The NB is also the only generation to feature a factory-built turbocharged variant in the form of the Mazdaspeed MX-5.</p>

                <p>The fourth-generation Mazda MX-5 was unveiled in 2014 and has been in production since 2015. An updated model was introduced in 2018 and is visually identical to the pre-update model. It has been designated as series "ND2" due to an engine upgrade to 135 kW (181 hp) and several other improvements around the car. The ND generation introduced a Retractable Fastback (RF) variant that features a rigid roof and buttresses that give the silhouette a more coupé-like appearance than the soft top convertible. The fourth generation MX-5 has received several accolades such as the 2015-2016 Car of the Year Japan Award, the 2016 World Car of the Year Award, Car and Driver's 10Best list from 2016 to 2019, and the Red Dot Best of the Best Award in Product Design 2017. In addition, the car is the basis for the Fiat 124 Spider and Abarth 124 Spider.</p>
                <p>The Mazda MX-5 (ND) is the fourth and current generation of the Mazda MX-5. Mazda officially unveiled the car on September 3, 2014 in the United States and Spain, and on September 4, 2014 in Japan.[5][6] The new MX-5 was presented at the October 2014 Paris Motor Show, and at the November 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show. The car is manufactured in Mazda's Hiroshima plant.[7] The vehicle was released in the third quarter of 2015. In the US, the release price of the MX-5 was between $24,915 and $30,065.[8] On March 24, 2016 the MX-5 was awarded World Car of the Year (WCOTY) and the World Car Design of the Year at the New York Auto Show. It was the second Mazda to win WCOTY following the Demio/Mazda2 in 2008.[9]</p>

                <p>The Battery Tender Global MX-5 Cup is the professional Spec Miata series sanctioned by IndyCar in the United States. The pro Spec Miata series has its roots in 2003, but a unified national championship was launched in 2006.</p>
                <p>For 2016 the Global MX-5 Cup was launched. The series featured the new fourth generation Mazda MX-5, and a new prize package. The winner of the series was invited to test a Mazda powered Lola B08/80 prepared by Mazda Motorsports.[19] Last seasons championship contenders Dean II and Gallagher again competed at the front of the pack. Gallagher won the first race after Dean II started from pole position.[20] The championship was won by 26-year old Nathanial Sparks. Sparks won a $200,000 scholarship to advance his racing career.[21] The season culminated with a new shootout format. The Mazda MX-5 Cup Global Invitational debuted with nineteen drivers from eight different countries. The inaugural edition was won by Sparks. Former FIA GT1 racer Gabriele Gardel also competed in the race. For 2017 sanctioning of the series was taken over from SCCA Pro Racing to IndyCar. Promotion of the series was taken over by Andersen Promotions. Andersen Promotions, headed by Dan Andersen, also promotes and runs all series of the Road to Indy (USF2000, Pro Mazda Championship and Indy Lights). The Global MX-5 Series joined the IndyCar Series at the Grand Prix of Alabama, Kohler Grand Prix, Honda Indy Toronto and the Grand Prix at The Glen.</p>
